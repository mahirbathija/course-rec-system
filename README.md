# Course Recommendation System

This project was created becasue I had lots of trouble choosing which classes to take during my undergradute degree at the University of Washington. It creates a MongoDB database that stores information about students, courses taken and course information. It uses collaborative filtering to recommend courses for current users and BFS on weighted a graph to accomodate new users.
